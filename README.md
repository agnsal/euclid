# Euclid
Euclid is an Embedded Systems Project, consisting of a C program, tested via ISS and VHDL.
This program performs Euclid’s Algorithm to find the value of GCD(x, y), that is the Greatest Common Divisor of
two integers.


You can see needed tools, dependencies and the steps I followed to create it on Euclid.pdf. 
If you like, you can change C program file and follow Euclid.pdf instructions to change System behaviour.
